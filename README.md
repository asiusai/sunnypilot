Asius cloud uploads are encrypted. The app controls uploads and access.
Data sharing for product improvement is off by default. Comma and sunnylink receive no driving data from this fork.

The driver-facing camera and microphone are only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings.

Local logs and crash diagnostics remain available on the device.
